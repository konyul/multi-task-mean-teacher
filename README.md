# multi-task-mean-teacher
Multi task learning with pseudo labels created by teacher.



This is multi-task learning which has auxiliary task.

While training, we can benefit from pseudo labels created by teacher.
This is accomplished by training teacher.py.

We can just do multi task learning by training student.py which is normal multi-task learning
